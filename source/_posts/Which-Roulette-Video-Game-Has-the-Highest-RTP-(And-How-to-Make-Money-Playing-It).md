#  Highest RTP Roulette Games: Play These for Maximum Profit! 

When playing casino games, it's important to select those with the highest return-to-player (RTP) percentages. This ensures you'll get the most bang for your buck – or in this case, the most spins for your money. 

Roulette is one of the easiest casino games to play and offers some of the best odds in the house. So it's no surprise that many players choose to spin the wheel at the roulette table. And while there are a number of different variants of roulette available, all with their own unique quirks and betting options, they all share a common goal: to correctly predict where the ball will end up after it's spun around the wheel. 

But before you can start predicting, you first need to know which variant offers the best chances of winning. Luckily for you, we've done all the hard work and have compiled a list of the top five highest RTP roulette games currently available online. So without further ado, here they are:

1. European Roulette – 97.3% RTP 

European Roulette is our top pick for the best high RTP roulette game available online. With an RTP of 97.3%, this variant offers slightly better odds than its American counterpart, which has a 96.5% RTP. The only downside is that European Roulette has a lower maximum bet limit than American Roulette (500 vs 5,000), but if you're looking to play for high stakes, then American Roulette is probably not your best option anyway! 
2. French Roulette – 97% RTP 

If European Roulette isn't your thing, then French Roulette may be a more appealing option with its 97% RTP. This variant also offers some nice bonus features like La Partage and En Prison rules, which give players a better chance of recouping some of their losses when bets go wrong. 
3. Premium American Roulette – 96% RTP 
Premium American Roulettel has an impressive RTP of 96%, making it one of the higher paying variants available online. The game also comes with a range of betting options and features an extended double zero pocket for those looking for extra excitement (or just extra risk!). 
4. Multi Wheel Roulette – 94% RTP 
Multi Wheel Rouletteworks by allowing players to bet on up to eight wheels simultaneously (hence the name), increasing their chances of winning on any given spin exponentially! The game has an RTP of 94%, making it another excellent choice for those looking to maximise their profits while playing roulette online. 
5. 3D European Roulette Gold – 94% RTP 

Last but not least on our list is 3D European Roulettewith its impressive 94% RTP percentage. This luxurious game comes complete with hi-definition graphics and realistic sound effects that will make you feel like you're right there at the casino table!
