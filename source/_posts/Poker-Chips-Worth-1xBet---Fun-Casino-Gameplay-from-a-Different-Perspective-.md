#  Understanding the Differences Between Poker Chip Values at Different Casinos 

When you go to a casino, there are all sorts of different poker chip values. The question is, what does it all mean?

There are a few things you need to know about poker chip values at casinos. The first is that the values vary from casino to casino. They also vary depending on the game that is being played.

- Green chips are usually worth between $25 and $100 each 
- Black chips are usually worth between $100 and $1,000 each 

Of course, these aren't hard and fast rules - they may vary from casino to casino. So it's always a good idea to ask the dealer what the specific values are for the game you're playing.
