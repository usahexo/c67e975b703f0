#  Bingo for kids: how young is too young?

Is your little one begging to join in on the bingo fun? Here’s what you need to know about how young is too young to start playing this classic casino game.

Generally speaking, experts say that you can start introducing gambling games like bingo to kids as early as six or seven years old. A big part of it depends on how mature your child is and how well you think they can handle winning and losing money.

If you do decide to let them play, make sure to set some ground rules first. Explain that bingo is a game of chance, and that they could lose money just as easily as they could win it.
