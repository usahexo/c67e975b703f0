        <h1 id="Nevada-Legal-Gambling-Age-is-21"><a href="#Nevada-Legal-Gambling-Age-is-21" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Legal Gambling Age is 21"></a>Nevada Legal Gambling Age is 21</h1><p>Nevada has some of the loosest gambling laws in the United States. This includes a legal gambling age of 21. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. The following covers the legal Nevada gambling age and what activities are included.</p>
<p>The state of Nevada allows anyone 21 years or older to gamble in its casinos and card rooms. This includes playing casino games, poker, bingo, and betting on sports. There are no other restrictions on gambling such as race or residency requirements.</p>
<p>However, there are a few exceptions to the legal Nevada gambling age. Social gambling is allowed for those 18 years or older. This includes card games like bridge or poker among friends in someone’s home. It also includes betting small amounts of money on non-casino games like dice or coin tosses.</p>
<p>There is also a lower minimum legal gambling age for some games at some casinos. These include blackjack (18), craps (18), and roulette (21). Check with the casino before you visit to see if they have any lower minimums for other games.</p>
<p>If you are under 21 years old but want to gamble, you can go to one of Nevada’s Indian reservations casinos. These casinos have their own rules about the minimum legal gambling age which can vary from 18 to 21 years old.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Gaming-Commission-Sets-Minimum-Legal-Gambling-Age-at-21"><a href="#Nevada-Gaming-Commission-Sets-Minimum-Legal-Gambling-Age-at-21" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Gaming Commission Sets Minimum Legal Gambling Age at 21"></a>Nevada Gaming Commission Sets Minimum Legal Gambling Age at 21</h1><p>The Nevada Gaming Commission voted unanimously on Wednesday to set the minimum legal gambling age at 21. The new law will take effect on January 1, 2020.</p>
<p>Commission chairman Tony Alamo said, “This is a seminal moment for the commission and for the gaming industry in Nevada. Our responsibility is to protect the public, and this is an important step in doing that.”</p>
<p>Under the new law, anyone under 21 will be prohibited from gambling in casinos, playing poker or bingo, or betting on sports. They will also be banned from entering gaming areas in casinos or racetracks.</p>
<p>Republican State Senator Ira Hansen applauded the commission’s decision, saying it will help ensure that young people do not develop gambling addictions. “It’s a great day for Nevada,” he said. “We’re preventing young people from getting addicted to gambling at an early age.”</p>
<p>Democratic Assemblyman Nelson Araujo criticized the commission’s decision, saying it will drive young people to unregulated forms of gambling. “This is a bad decision that will have negative consequences for our state,” he said. “It will force young people to gamble illegally, and that’s not good for anyone.”</p>
<p>The commission’s vote comes after years of debate over the minimum legal gambling age. Advocates for raising the age argue that it will protect young people from developing addictive behaviors, while opponents say it will drive business to unregulated forms of gambling.</p>

Gambling Age in Nevada Increases to 21"></a>Minimum Legal Gambling Age in Nevada Increases to 21</h1><p>The Nevada Gaming Commission recently increased the gambling age from 18 to 21. The change, which was unanimously approved, goes into effect on January 1, 2019.</p>
<p>“It’s something that we’ve been discussing for some time and feel like it’s the right thing to do,” said gaming commission chairman Tony Alamo.</p>
<p>Alamo said the decision was based on several factors, including protecting consumers and reducing gambling addiction. He added that many other states have a 21-year-old gambling age.</p>
<p>Some 18-year-olds were not happy with the decision. Quintin Hahn said he often gambles at casinos in downtown Reno and doesn’t think it’s fair that people his age will no longer be able to do so.</p>
<p>“I turned 18 a few months ago and now I can no longer gamble here? That doesn’t seem right to me, but I guess it is what it is,” he said.</p>
<p>Others believe the increase is a positive step. Margarita Avilez works at a non-profit organization that provides assistance to people with gambling addictions. She supports the move to raise the age limit.</p>
<p>“We need to do whatever we can to help protect people from developing a gambling addiction and this is one step in the right direction,” she said.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Raises-Minimum-Legal-Gambling-Age-to-21"><a href="#Nevada-Raises-Minimum-Legal-Gambling-Age-to-21" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Raises Minimum Legal Gambling Age to 21"></a>Nevada Raises Minimum Legal Gambling Age to 21</h1><p>The Nevada Gaming Commission has unanimously approved a measure that will raise the minimum legal gambling age in the state from 18 to 21. The new policy will go into effect on January 1, 2019.</p>
<p>Governor Brian Sandoval, who chairs the commission, said that the move was made in order to protect young people from addiction and other negative consequences associated with gambling. “The decision to raise the age limit for gambling is not one we take lightly,” Governor Sandoval said in a statement.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure argue that it will hurt business at casinos and other gambling establishments. However, backers say that there is evidence that shows that most people do not begin gambling until they are 21 or older. In fact, a 2017 study by the University of Las Vegas found that only 15 percent of 18-year-olds gambled in Nevada in 2016.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Nevada has raised its minimum legal gambling age. The state increased the age from 18 to 21 in 1966, and then again raised it to 21 in 2001.</p>

        <h1 id="What-Does-Progressive-and-Non-Progressive-Gambling-Mean"><a href="#What-Does-Progressive-and-Non-Progressive-Gambling-Mean" class="headerlink" title="What Does Progressive and Non Progressive Gambling Mean?"></a>What Does Progressive and Non Progressive Gambling Mean?</h1><p>When it comes to gambling, there are two different types: progressive and non-progressive. Progressive gambling is when the amount of money being gambled on each bet progressively gets larger. Non-progressive gambling is when the amount wagered does not change from one bet to the next.</p>
<p>Most people think that progressive gambling is the safer option because the potential rewards are much higher than with non-progressive gambling. However, this is not always the case. In fact, progressive gambling can be more risky because you run the risk of losing everything in a single bet.</p>
<p>Non-progressive gambling is less risky because you are not risking as much money with each bet. However, the potential rewards are also lower. This type of gambling is ideal for those who want to gamble but don’t want to risk too much money.</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong answer when it comes to progressive or non-progressive gambling - it all depends on your personal preferences and risk tolerance. Just be sure to understand the risks and rewards involved before making a decision.</p>
<h1 id="What-Makes-a-Game-Progressive-or-Non-Progressive"><a href="#What-Makes-a-Game-Progressive-or-Non-Progressive" class="headerlink" title="What Makes a Game Progressive or Non Progressive?"></a>What Makes a Game Progressive or Non Progressive?</h1><p>For a game to be classified as “progressive”, it must have mechanics that evolve as the player progresses. This could be something as simple as enemies getting tougher as the player advances, or new abilities unlocking that change the way the game is played.</p>
<p>A good example of a progressive game is “Super Mario Odyssey”. As players progress, they unlock new hats that give them new powers, such as the ability to fly. These new abilities make it possible to explore previously inaccessible areas of the game world.</p>
<p>Non-progressive games, on the other hand, do not have any mechanics that evolve over time. This makes them more static and unchanging, with no real sense of progress. A good example of a non-progressive game is “Tetris”. There are no new abilities to unlock and no enemies that get tougher as you play. The only thing that changes is how quickly you complete each level.</p>
<p>Whether or not a game is progressive can be a contentious topic among gamers. Some people feel that all games should be progressive in order to provide a sense of evolution and advancement. Others believe that non-progressive games can still be enjoyable and provide a sense of satisfaction upon completion.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether or not a game is progressive comes down to personal preference. Some gamers prefer games that are constantly evolving, while others enjoy static experiences with no real sense of growth or development.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-Difference-Between-Progressive-and-Non-Progressive-Gambling"><a href="#What-is-the-Difference-Between-Progressive-and-Non-Progressive-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="What is the Difference Between Progressive and Non Progressive Gambling?"></a>What is the Difference Between Progressive and Non Progressive Gambling?</h1><p>The gambling industry is one of the most diverse and expansive industries in the world. Gambling can be traced back to ancient times, and its popularity has only grown in recent years. With new technologies and the ever-growing online casino industry, there are more gambling options than ever before.</p>
<p>There are two main types of gambling: progressive and non-progressive. For the most part, these two types of gambling are quite different from each other. In this article, we will explore the differences between progressive and non-progressive gambling.</p>
<p>The first difference between progressive and non-progressive gambling is how the bets are placed. In a progressive game, players make small bets that gradually add up to a larger bet. This is typically done by making multiple small bets at different points in time. In contrast, non-progressive games involve a single bet that is much larger than any of the individual bets in a progressive game.</p>
<p>The second main difference between these two types of gambling is how the payouts are determined. Progressive games have jackpots that increase in size as more players join the game. This means that the payouts can be quite large if someone wins the jackpot. Non-progressive games typically have fixed payouts that do not change regardless of how many players are involved in the game.</p>
<p>It is important to note that there are some exceptions to these general rules. For example, some progressive games have fixed jackpots, while some non-progressive games have jackpots that increase in size as more players join. However, these cases are rare, and most games fit into one category or another.</p>
<p>So, which type of gambling is better? The answer to this question depends on your preferences and goals. If you are looking for a chance to win a large jackpot, then progressive games are a better choice. However, if you prefer smaller wagers with more predictable payouts, then non-progressive games may be a better option for you.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-Advantages-of-Progressive-Gambling"><a href="#What-are-the-Advantages-of-Progressive-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="What are the Advantages of Progressive Gambling?"></a>What are the Advantages of Progressive Gambling?</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but it can also be an addictive habit that leads to financial ruin. So how can you tell if gambling is right for you? And what are the benefits of progressive gambling?</p>
<p>In general, there are two types of gamblers: recreational and problem. Recreational players gamble for fun and typically have no negative consequences. Problem gamblers, on the other hand, can’t control their urge to gamble and often suffer from financial and relationship problems as a result.</p>
<p>Progressive gambling is a type of gambling that offers potential benefits for both recreational and problem gamblers. For recreational players, progressive gambling offers the excitement of big wins with relatively low stakes. This makes it a less risky way to enjoy gambling without spending too much money.</p>
<p>For problem gamblers, progressive gambling can provide a way to gamble in a controlled environment. By betting small amounts and gradually increasing their bets as they win, problem gamblers can limit their losses while still enjoying the thrill of gambling. This helps them to stay in control while getting the excitement they crave.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-Disadvantages-of-Non-Progressive-Gambling"><a href="#What-are-the-Disadvantages-of-Non-Progressive-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="What are the Disadvantages of Non Progressive Gambling?"></a>What are the Disadvantages of Non Progressive Gambling?</h1><p>There are many disadvantages to gambling, but one of the main disadvantages is that it can be addictive. This means that you can lose control over how much you bet and when you bet, leading to serious financial and personal problems.</p>
<p>Gambling also tends to be a non-productive activity. This means that instead of using your time and money on something that would improve your life, you are using it on a game or wager that has no real value.</p>
<p>Gambling can also be damaging to relationships. When people are addicted to gambling, they often become secretive and isolated as they try to hide their addiction from loved ones. This can lead to arguments and resentment within relationships.</p>
<p>Gambling can also be damaging to mental health. Some people become so addicted to gambling that they lose all sense of reality and end up in debtors’ prison or with ruined lives.</p>

The first is that there are a number of different types of rehab centers, and the one that is best for you will depend on your specific needs.</p>
<p>The second thing you need to know is that not all rehab centers are created equal. Some are better than others, and it’s important to do your research before choosing one.</p>
<p>Here are some things to look for when choosing a gambling addiction rehab center:</p>
<ul>
<li>reputation * accreditation * treatment options * staff experience * location</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>Reputation: One of the most important things to look for when choosing a gambling addiction rehab center is its reputation. You want to make sure that the center has a good reputation and is known for providing quality treatment. You can ask friends or family members who have had experience with rehab centers, or you can do your own research online.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Accreditation: Another important thing to look for is accreditation. Gambling addiction rehab centers should be accredited by a credible organization such as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO). This means that the center has met certain quality standards and is held accountable by an outside organization.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Treatment Options: Another thing to consider when choosing a gambling addiction rehab center is the range of treatment options offered. The best centers will offer a variety of treatment options, including individual therapy, group therapy, and family therapy. They should also offer aftercare services so you can continue receiving support after completing treatment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Staff Experience: It’s important to choose a rehabilitation center with staff who have experience treating gambling addiction. The staff should be knowledgeable about the latest research on gambling addiction and how best to treat it. They should also be compassionate and understanding, and have experience working with people who have addictions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Location: Finally, you’ll want to consider the location of the rehabilitation center. It’s important that you feel comfortable with the location and that it’s easy for you to get to.</p>

        <h1 id="Biblical-Perspectives-on-Gambling"><a href="#Biblical-Perspectives-on-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Biblical Perspectives on Gambling"></a>Biblical Perspectives on Gambling</h1><p>The Bible is quite clear on the topic of gambling. In fact, there are several scriptures which explicitly condemn the practice. Gambling is viewed as a form of greed and covetousness, as well as being an addictive behavior that can lead to financial ruin.</p>
<p>“Now listen, you who say, ‘Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.’ Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. Instead, you ought to say, ‘If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that.’” – James 4:13-15</p>
<p>Gambling can be seen as an attempt to control fate or destiny, which is something that only God can do. It is also a form of idolatry, placing our trust in something other than God. Additionally, gambling can be quite addictive and destructive, leading people into poverty and despair.</p>
<p>In light of these biblical perspectives on gambling, it is clear that Christians should avoid this sinful behavior. We should instead put our trust in God, who alone knows the future and has our best interests at heart.</p>
<h1 id="Can-I-Gamble-and-Still-Be-a-Good-Christian"><a href="#Can-I-Gamble-and-Still-Be-a-Good-Christian" class="headerlink" title="Can I Gamble and Still Be a Good Christian?"></a>Can I Gamble and Still Be a Good Christian?</h1><p>Like many things in life, the answer to this question is a bit more complex than a simple yes or no. Gambling can be seen as ethically ambiguous, as it involves both taking risks and potentially winning or losing money.</p>
<p>For some people, gambling can be a fun and harmless way to pass the time. But for others, it can quickly become an addiction that ruins lives. So how can Christians reconcile their beliefs with gambling?</p>
<p>One thing to consider is that the Bible does not explicitly condemn gambling. However, there are several verses that suggest that gambling is not ideal behavior. For example, Proverbs says “the rich rules over the poor, and the borrower is the slave of the lender” (Proverbs 22:7). This verse hints at the dangers of gambling, as it can lead to someone becoming indebted to others.</p>
<p>Another passage that may be relevant to gambling is 1 Timothy 6:10, which says “for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.” This verse suggests that greed can be dangerous and lead people away from God.</p>
<p>When it comes to gambling, Christians should ask themselves if they are doing it for fun or if they are addicted to it. If someone is addicted to gambling, then it is likely not compatible with being a Christian. Gambling can be harmful both physically and emotionally, and it can lead to financial ruin.</p>
<p>However, if someone gambles responsibly and does not let it become a problem, then there is no reason why they cannot be a good Christian. Gambling can be seen as a form of entertainment, similar to watching TV or going to the movies. As long as someone isn’t harming themselves or others, there is no reason why they can’t enjoy a friendly game of poker or bet on a horse race every now and then.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Gambling-a-Sin"><a href="#Is-Gambling-a-Sin" class="headerlink" title="Is Gambling a Sin?"></a>Is Gambling a Sin?</h1><p>Gambling has been around for centuries and has been a part of many cultures. Some people believe that gambling is a sin, while others believe that it is a form of entertainment. Whether or not gambling is a sin is up for debate, but there are certainly pros and cons to gambling.</p>
<p>One of the pros to gambling is that it can be fun. Gambling can be a way to escape from reality and to have some fun. There is a certain thrill that comes with gambling, and some people find it addictive.</p>
<p>Another pro to gambling is that it can be profitable. Some people are able to win big money by gambling, which can be very exciting. Gambling can also provide a way to make some extra money on the side.</p>
<p>However, there are also several cons to gambling. One of the biggest cons is that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin. Gambling can also be stressful and lead to ruined relationships. Additionally, gambling can be harmful to mental health, especially if someone develops a addiction to gambling.</p>
<h1 id="The-Bible-and-Gambling-What-Does-the-Scripture-Say"><a href="#The-Bible-and-Gambling-What-Does-the-Scripture-Say" class="headerlink" title="The Bible and Gambling: What Does the Scripture Say?"></a>The Bible and Gambling: What Does the Scripture Say?</h1><p>When it comes to gambling, the Bible doesn’t explicitly say whether or not it’s a sin. However, there are a few verses that offer some insight on the topic.</p>
<p>First, let’s look at what the Bible says about gambling in general. The basic principle is that anything that involves gambling with something of value is considered to be sinful. This includes taking risks with something you need for survival, such as food or clothing.</p>
<p>Proverbs 23:4-5 says, “Do not wear yourself out to get rich; have the wisdom to show restraint. Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone, for they will certainly sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle.” This verse teaches that greed is foolish and can lead to ruin.</p>
<p>So, why is greed one of the main reasons people gamble? Often, people gamble in the hopes of getting rich quickly. But as we see from Proverbs, this is not a wise decision. Gambling can quickly consume your money and leave you with nothing.</p>
<p>In addition, gambling can lead to other sins such as anger, envy, and hatred. These negative emotions can damage relationships with others and even God Himself. James 1:19-20 says, “My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry , because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.”</p>
<p>Gambling also promotes a false sense of security . People often think that if they gamble enough money or win enough times, they will never lose again. But this is not true – everyone eventually loses in gambling. In fact, casinos rely on people losing money so that they can make profits! So rather than providing security , gambling actually creates more insecurity .</p>
<p>Finally, let’s look at some specific Bible verses about gambling . In 1 Timothy 6:10 , Paul tells us not to “gamble for God’s cause” because this is foolishness . He goes on to say that we should work hard so that we can provide for ourselves and contribute to society . In other words , Paul is saying that it’s better to be productive than waste your time gambling .</p>
<p>Another verse that speaks against gambling is Luke 12:15 . Here Jesus says , “And he said unto them , Take heed , and beware of covetousness : for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth .” In other words , Jesus is saying that having lots of stuff doesn’t guarantee happiness – in fact, it can actually lead to covetousness (greed).</p>
<p>So what do all these verses mean for Christians? Basically , they teach us that gambling is sinful because it leads to greediness, idolatry (putting money above God), and other harmful emotions . While there may be some cases where gambling is okay (such as if you are using your own money), Christians should generally avoid it because of its many dangers.</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-the-Bible-Say-About-Betting"><a href="#What-Does-the-Bible-Say-About-Betting" class="headerlink" title="What Does the Bible Say About Betting?"></a>What Does the Bible Say About Betting?</h1><p>The Bible doesn’t explicitly say anything about betting, but there are a few principles we can glean from it that can help us make a decision about whether or not betting is okay.</p>
<p>First, the Bible tells us to do everything in moderation (1 Corinthians 9:25). This means that we should only bet what we can afford to lose and never put ourselves in a situation where we could lose more than we’re comfortable with.</p>
<p>Second, the Bible tells us to be content with what we have (Philippians 4:11). This means that we shouldn’t gamble in an attempt to get rich or increase our wealth. Instead, we should be content with what God has given us.</p>
<p>Finally, the Bible warns us against greediness (Colossians 3:5). This means that we should avoid gambling because it can lead to greed and covetousness. Gambling can cause us to focus on the things money can buy instead of focusing on the things money can’t buy, which is what the Lord desires for us.</p>
<p>While there’s no clear-cut answer about whether or not betting is okay, these principles provide some guidance. Ultimately, it’s up to each individual to decide what they believe is right.</p>

        <h1 id="Riverwind-Casino-increasing-minimum-age-to-21-for-slots-play"><a href="#Riverwind-Casino-increasing-minimum-age-to-21-for-slots-play" class="headerlink" title="Riverwind Casino increasing minimum age to 21 for slots play"></a>Riverwind Casino increasing minimum age to 21 for slots play</h1><p>The management of Riverwind Casino has announced that starting on January 1, 2019, the minimum age for playing slots will be raised to 21. This policy change is being made as part of an effort to reduce problem gambling among younger patrons.</p>
<p>Casino officials say that they have been monitoring the gaming habits of their customers and have observed a concerning trend of younger people becoming addicted to slot machines. By raising the minimum age for slots play, Riverwind hopes to discourage these individuals from spending too much time and money at the casino.</p>
<p>The new age restriction will apply not just to Riverwind Casino but also its sister property, Gold Town Casino in Norman. Anyone under 21 who wishes to play slots at either casino will need to provide proof of age.</p>
<p>This news comes as a disappointment to many local residents who enjoy gambling in their free time. Some people are already planning to travel to other states where the minimum age for slots is lower.</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, casino officials remain confident that this policy change is necessary for the well-being of their customers. They hope that those affected by the change will find other activities to enjoy at Riverwind and Gold Town Casinos.</p>
<h1 id="Oklahoma’s-Riverwind-Casino-raising-minimum-age-to-21-for-slots"><a href="#Oklahoma’s-Riverwind-Casino-raising-minimum-age-to-21-for-slots" class="headerlink" title="Oklahoma’s Riverwind Casino raising minimum age to 21 for slots"></a>Oklahoma’s Riverwind Casino raising minimum age to 21 for slots</h1><p>The Riverwind Casino, located in Norman, Oklahoma, is raising its minimum age for gambling on slot machines from 18 to 21. The change will go into effect on Friday, February 1st.</p>
<p>“The health and safety of our guests is always our number one priority,” said a spokesperson for the casino in a statement. “This new policy is intended to provide a more enjoyable experience for our guests who are of legal drinking age.”</p>
<p>The announcement has been met with mixed reactions. Some people argue that it’s unconstitutional for the government to tell adults what they can and cannot do in their own free time. Others say that it’s a responsible move that will help protect vulnerable young people from addictive behavior.</p>
<p>Riverwind isn’t the only casino making this change; both the WinStar World Casino and Resort and the Choctaw Nation Casino have also announced plans to raise their minimum age to 21.</p>
<h1 id="Riverwind-Online-Casino-OKC-Raises-Minimum-Age-Limit-For-Slots-Play-To-21"><a href="#Riverwind-Online-Casino-OKC-Raises-Minimum-Age-Limit-For-Slots-Play-To-21" class="headerlink" title="Riverwind Online Casino OKC Raises Minimum Age Limit For Slots Play To 21"></a>Riverwind Online Casino OKC Raises Minimum Age Limit For Slots Play To 21</h1><p>In a move designed to protect its youngest players, Riverwind Casino in Oklahoma City has raised the minimum age limit for slots play from 18 to 21. The new policy went into effect on Monday, June 11.</p>
<p>Riverwind Casino Marketing Director Matt clarifyed that the decision to raise the minimum age limit was not made lightly. “The safety and well-being of our guests is always our number one priority,” he said.</p>
<p>According to Matt, the average age of slot machine players at Riverwind is around 36. “Given that, we decided it was time to make this change.”</p>
<p>The decision does not affect other casino games such as blackjack and craps, which still have a minimum age requirement of 18.</p>
<h1 id="Riverwind-casino-OKC-announces-increase-in-minimum-age-to-play-slots-from-18-to-21"><a href="#Riverwind-casino-OKC-announces-increase-in-minimum-age-to-play-slots-from-18-to-21" class="headerlink" title="Riverwind casino OKC announces increase in minimum age to play slots from 18 to 21"></a>Riverwind casino OKC announces increase in minimum age to play slots from 18 to 21</h1><p>The Riverwind casino in Oklahoma City has announced that, as of September 1st, the minimum age to play slots will be increased from 18 to 21. In a press release, the casino said that the change is being made “to better align with industry standards and provide our guests with a more enjoyable experience.”</p>
<p>While the move may not please everyone, most people seem to agree that it’s a sensible decision. After all, an increasing number of casinos are making the same move, and young adults often have other things they’d rather be doing than gambling.</p>
<p>“We feel this is a positive change for our guests and our property,” said Kyle Dean, Vice President of Slot Operations at Riverwind Casino. “ Raising the minimum age to play slots will create a more pleasant environment for all of our guests.”</p>
<p>The change is also good news for casino employees, many of whom are in their early twenties. With the new age requirement in place, they’ll now be able to work in the casino without having to worry about competing against younger players.</p>
<p>So far, reaction to the news has been largely positive. “I’m glad they’re doing this,” said one guest on social media. “It’s about time something was done to make slots less appealing to kids.”</p>
<h1 id="Riverwind-casino-increasing-the-minimum-age-to21-for-slot-play"><a href="#Riverwind-casino-increasing-the-minimum-age-to21-for-slot-play" class="headerlink" title="Riverwind casino increasing the minimum age to21 for slot play"></a>Riverwind casino increasing the minimum age to21 for slot play</h1><p>The Riverwind casino is increasing the minimum age to21 for slot play. The change will go into effect onAugust 1.</p>
<p>“We continuously review our policies and procedures to ensure that we are providing the best guest experience possible,” said general manager of Riverwind Casino, Matt Morgan.</p>
<p>Guests who are 18 through 20 years old will still be able to play table games and enjoy all other aspects of the casino.</p>
<p>This change comes as other casinos across the state have increased their minimum age for slot play to 21 in recent years.</p>

The casino is reported to have generated significant profits for the PNL over the past several years.</p>
<p>“It is with great pleasure that we can announce the acquisition of Winners Casino,” said Carlos Correia, CEO of the PNL. “This casino has been a tremendous source of revenue for us, and we are confident that we can continue to grow its profits in the years to come.”</p>
<p>The PNL did not disclose how much it paid for the casino, but insiders say that the sum was substantial.</p>
<p>Winners Casino is a popular destination for gamblers in northern Nevada. It features a gaming floor with more than 200 slot machines and a dozen table games. In addition, the casino has a 24-hour restaurant and lounge.</p>
<p>The PNL said that it plans to keep the casino’s current management team in place and that there will be no changes to its operations.</p>
<h1 id="Winners-Casino-in-Winnemucca-Confirms-its-Portugal-National-Lottery-Ownership"><a href="#Winners-Casino-in-Winnemucca-Confirms-its-Portugal-National-Lottery-Ownership" class="headerlink" title="Winners Casino in Winnemucca Confirms its Portugal National Lottery Ownership"></a>Winners Casino in Winnemucca Confirms its Portugal National Lottery Ownership</h1><p>As of September 25th, 2018, Winners Casino in Winnemucca has confirmed its Portugal National Lottery ownership. Rumors had been flying for weeks that the casino was preparing to switch ownership, but management had repeatedly declined to comment on the situation. A press release from management finally put the rumors to rest.</p>
<p>The Portugal National Lottery is one of the largest and most popular lottery organizations in Europe. Winners Casino Winnemucca is one of the first casinos in North America to be owned by the organization.</p>
<p>“We are very excited about this new partnership,” said casino manager Jerry Snyder in a statement. “The Portugal National Lottery is a well-respected organization with a great track record. We believe that this will be good for both our casino and our customers.”</p>
<p>There are no immediate plans for changes at the casino, but Snyder promised that there would be more information forthcoming in the near future. He also thanked the casino’s employees and customers for their support over the years.</p>
<h1 id="Portugal’s-National-Lottery-to-Take-Over-Management-of-Winners-Casino-in-Winnemucca"><a href="#Portugal’s-National-Lottery-to-Take-Over-Management-of-Winners-Casino-in-Winnemucca" class="headerlink" title="Portugal’s National Lottery to Take Over Management of Winners Casino in Winnemucca"></a>Portugal’s National Lottery to Take Over Management of Winners Casino in Winnemucca</h1><p>The Portuguese National Lottery (Lotto) is set to take over the management of Winners Casino in Winnemucca, Nevada. The casino, which is currently owned by Aristocrat Gaming Corporation, will be operated by Lotto under a new agreement that was reached between the two companies.</p>
<p>According to the agreement, Lotto will take over all of the day-to-day operations of the casino, including marketing, human resources, and accounting. Aristocrat Gaming Corporation will continue to own the casino, but Lotto will have full operational control.</p>
<p>The move is being seen as a major win for Lotto, as it will give them a foothold in the US gaming market. Winners Casino is one of only a few casinos in Nevada that is currently operated by a foreign company.</p>
<p>Lotto’s CEO, José Pedro Ferreira, said that he was “very excited” about the agreement. “This is an important step for us as we pursue our goal of becoming a global leader in the gaming industry,” he said.</p>
<p>The takeover is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks.</p>
<h1 id="Winners-Casino-in-Winnemucca-Sold-to-Portugal’s-National-Lottery"><a href="#Winners-Casino-in-Winnemucca-Sold-to-Portugal’s-National-Lottery" class="headerlink" title="Winners Casino in Winnemucca Sold to Portugal’s National Lottery"></a>Winners Casino in Winnemucca Sold to Portugal’s National Lottery</h1><p>The Winners Casino in Winnemucca was sold to the Portugal’s National Lottery this week. The casino has been a big part of the community since it opened in 2001 and is one of the only casinos in the state of Nevada.</p>
<p>The sale of the casino has many people concerned about what will happen to the jobs of the more than two hundred employees at the casino. The National Lottery has not said what their plans are for the casino, but there is speculation that they may close it down and move operations to another part of the country.</p>
<p>There is also concern about what this will mean for the community as a whole. The Winners Casino is a major employer in Winnemucca and provides a lot of support for local charities and other organizations. It is unknown if or how much money the National Lottery will invest in the community now that they have purchased the casino.</p>
<p>It is hoped that whatever happens with the Winners Casino, the workers will be able to keep their jobs and that the National Lottery will continue to support local organizations.</p>
<h1 id="New-Owners-of-Winners-Casino-in-Winnemucca-Bring-Exciting-Changes"><a href="#New-Owners-of-Winners-Casino-in-Winnemucca-Bring-Exciting-Changes" class="headerlink" title="New Owners of Winners Casino in Winnemucca Bring Exciting Changes"></a>New Owners of Winners Casino in Winnemucca Bring Exciting Changes</h1><p>In 2017, the Winners Casino in Winnemucca was bought by new owners. These new owners have brought about many exciting changes to the casino. This article will take a look at some of the changes that have taken place since the acquisition.</p>
<p>One of the first things that the new owners did was to change the name of the casino. It is now known as The Gold Nugget Casino. They also made significant renovations to the casino. Some of these renovations include a new bar area, a new buffet, and a new steakhouse. In addition to these renovations, they have also added several new slot machines and table games to the casino floor.</p>
<p>Another thing that the new owners did was to add a hotel to the casino property. This hotel has 100 rooms and it is already becoming one of the most popular places to stay in Winnemucca. The Gold Nugget Casino is also now home to two restaurants. One is an all-you-can-eat buffet, and the other is a steakhouse that serves up some of the best steaks in town.</p>
<p>The Gold Nugget Casino has also become very involved in the community since it has been under new ownership. They have partnered with several organizations in Winnemucca, and they have pledged to donate money to various charities throughout the year.</p>
<p>All in all, it is clear that The Gold Nugget Casino has undergone some major changes since it was acquired by its new owners. These changes have been welcomed by both players and locals alike, and it is safe to say that things are looking bright for this casino going forward.</p>

<h1 id="Foxwoods-Casino’s-Mega-Money-Rush-game-proves-to-be-a-smash-hit"><a href="#Foxwoods-Casino’s-Mega-Money-Rush-game-proves-to-be-a-smash-hit" class="headerlink" title="Foxwoods Casino’s Mega Money Rush game proves to be a smash hit!"></a>Foxwoods Casino’s Mega Money Rush game proves to be a smash hit!</h1><p>Connecticut’s Foxwoods Casino is reporting that its new Mega Money Rush game is a smash hit with gamblers. The game, which debuted in February, is a hybrid of slot and bingo games, and allows players to win up to $250,000 on a single spin.</p>
<p>“The response to Mega Money Rush has been phenomenal,” said Erin Barber, spokesperson for Foxwoods Casino. “It’s a fun and exciting game that offers players the chance to win big prizes, and we’re thrilled that it’s been so popular.”</p>
<p>Mega Money Rush is a fast-paced game that features five different jackpots, including a top prize of $250,000. To play, players purchase cards for $5 each and then try to match as many numbers as possible on their cards. The more matches a player makes, the bigger the prize they can win.</p>
<p>“Mega Money Rush is one of those games that’s really easy to learn but hard to master,” said Barber. “Players are constantly trying to figure out new ways to rack up bonus points and increase their chances of winning one of the big jackpots.”</p>
<p>So far, Foxwoods Casino has paid out more than $1 million in prizes to players who have played Mega Money Rush. And with jackpots that reach into the six figures, there’s plenty of incentive for gamers to give it a try.</p>

        <h1 id="Speed-Baccarat-is-a-Fast-and-Exciting-Game"><a href="#Speed-Baccarat-is-a-Fast-and-Exciting-Game" class="headerlink" title="Speed Baccarat is a Fast and Exciting Game!"></a>Speed Baccarat is a Fast and Exciting Game!</h1><p>Speed Baccarat is quickly becoming one of the most popular games in casinos all over the world. This fast and exciting game is perfect for players who want a thrilling gaming experience with minimum hassle.</p>
<p>What is Speed Baccarat?</p>
<p>Speed Baccarat is a variation of the traditional baccarat game. The rules are simple and streamlined, making it easy for new players to get into the action quickly. The game moves at a fast pace, making it an adrenaline-pumping experience that is sure to keep players on the edge of their seats.</p>
<p>How to Play Speed Baccarat</p>
<p>To play Speed Baccarat, all you need is a bet and two cards. The player’s goal is to get as close to nine as possible, without going over. The dealer will also give themselves two cards, and the goal is to beat the player’s total score. If the dealer has a higher score than the player, then the player loses; if the dealer has a lower score than the player, then the player wins.</p>
<p>Winning Strategies for Speed Baccarat</p>
<p>There are several winning strategies that can be used for Speed Baccarat. One strategy is to bet on both hands when playing against the dealer – this increases your chances of winning while also minimizing your losses if you do happen to lose. Another strategy is to always stay under nine points – this will ensure that you always have a chance of winning, even if your opponent has a high score.</p>
<h1 id="Get-in-on-the-Action-with-Speed-Baccarat"><a href="#Get-in-on-the-Action-with-Speed-Baccarat" class="headerlink" title="Get in on the Action with Speed Baccarat!"></a>Get in on the Action with Speed Baccarat!</h1><p>If you’re looking for an exciting, fast-paced game to get in on the action, look no further than Speed Baccarat! This thrilling variation of the classic casino game is gaining in popularity, and for good reason – it’s quick, easy to learn, and a ton of fun.</p>
<p>In Speed Baccarat, players are dealt two cards each and the goal is to get as close to 9 as possible. Points are counted as follows: face cards and 10s are worth 0 points, aces are worth 1 point, 2s through 9s are worth their face value. The player with the highest total score wins – if both players have the same total score, the game is a draw.</p>
<p>Speed Baccarat is played with six decks of cards which are shuffled together before each hand. Cards are dealt one at a time and players can either take another card or stand pat depending on the total value of their cards. In most cases, it’s best to take another card as this will increase your chances of getting as close to 9 as possible.</p>
<p>There are three betting options in Speed Baccarat: Player, Banker, and Tie. The Player bet is simply betting on which player will have the higher score at the end of the hand. The Banker bet is a bit more complicated – you’re betting on whether the Banker will have a higher score than the Player OR whether the tie will be broken in favour of the Banker. Finally, the Tie bet is just like it sounds – you’re betting that the two hands will tie.</p>
<p>One thing that makes Speed Baccarat so popular is that it’s such an adrenalin rush to play! With rounds taking just a few minutes to complete, there’s never any long lulls between hands – you can be constantly playing without having to wait long periods of time for another round to start. This makes it perfect for those who want non-stop action without having to commit hours at a time to playing.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Get in on the action with Speed Baccarat today!</p>

<h1 id="For-a-Fast-Paced-Game-Try-Speed-Baccarat"><a href="#For-a-Fast-Paced-Game-Try-Speed-Baccarat" class="headerlink" title="For a Fast-Paced Game, Try Speed Baccarat"></a>For a Fast-Paced Game, Try Speed Baccarat</h1><p>If you’re looking for a fast-paced game that will keep you on the edge of your seat, try Speed Baccarat. This game is played with six decks of cards, and the aim is to get as close to 9 as possible. There are a few things that make this game unique:</p>
<p>-The banker can only draw one card, and the player can draw two.</p>
<p>-A player needs at least a 2 to hit, and the ace counts as 1.</p>
<p>-Player or banker cards of 2 through 9 are worth face value.</p>
<p>-Tens, Jacks, Queens, and Kings are all worth 0.</p>
<p>-Ace is worth 1 or 11, whichever benefits the player the most.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to play Speed Baccarat: heads up (2 players), three players (cutthroat), or four players (general). In heads up or three player games, the banker always has an advantage because they can see all of the cards in the deck (the player only sees 3). In four player games, there is more chance for the player to win because it’s more like traditional baccarat where both player and banker have an equal chance to win.</p>
<p>Some basic strategy for Speed Baccarat includes knowing when to hit and when to stand. For example, if you have a 5 and 6, you would hit on a 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. If you have a 2 and an Ace, you would stand because it’s better to have 21 than 20 (since an Ace can be either 1 or 11). You may also want to Double Down if you have 11 – this means you’ll place an extra bet equal to your original bet and receive one more card. If that card is a 10 or higher, you’ll win twice your original bet; if it’s lower than 10, you lose your Double Down bet.</p>
