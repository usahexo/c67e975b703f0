<li>Always be prepared.</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure you have all the necessary supplies before heading out into the wilderness. This includes a map, compass, first-aid kit, food, water, and shelter.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Stay calm and avoid panicking.</li>
</ol>
<p>When faced with a difficult situation, try to stay calm and think things through rationally. Panicking will only make things worse.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use your head.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to use your head when in the wilderness – i.e., don’t take unnecessary risks, be aware of your surroundings at all times, etc.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Be alert and aware of your surroundings.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is especially important when travelling in areas that are known for being dangerous, such as bear country or snake-infested areas. Make noise when you’re hiking so that you don’t startle any wildlife, and keep an eye out for signs of danger (e.g., snakes sunning themselves on the trail).</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Dress appropriately for the climate and terrain.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re travelling in a cold weather environment, dress in layers so that you can adjust your clothing as needed to stay warm. And if you’re travelling in a hot climate, wear light clothing that will allow you to breathe easily and stay cool. Additionally, always wear sturdy shoes that will provide good traction on different types of terrain. Flip-flops are not recommended for hiking!</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Carry enough food and water for your trip.<br>2 days worth at least!</li>
</ol>
<p> 7days….or more…..better safe than sorry 🙂</p>
<p> 6 days worth of drinking water (1 gallon per person per day),  6 days worth of food . If trekking or doing an outdoor activity where there is no chance of returning to civilization within 24 hours then increase water supply to 8 days worth of water( 1 gallon per person per day).</p>
<p>8..Be familiar with basic first aid procedures.<br>In case of an emergency, it’s important to know how to administer first aid properly. Make sure you take a first-aid course prior to embarking on your trip into the wilderness.<br>9..Pack a survival kit.<br>A survival kit should include items such as a knife, matches, waterproof container,, tarpaulin,, insect repellent,, Sunscreen,, sunglasses,, head lamp,, whistle,, multi-tool,. This way you’ll be prepared for any contingency that may arise while out in the wilderness.<br>10..Stay positive and never give up.<br>No matter how difficult things get – always stay positive and never give up! With determination and perseverance, you can overcome any obstacle thrown your way while camping or hiking in the wilderness</p>

<h1 id="Master-The-Art-Of-Dealing-Wilder-In-Just-10-Easy-Steps"><a href="#Master-The-Art-Of-Dealing-Wilder-In-Just-10-Easy-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Master The Art Of Dealing Wilder In Just 10 Easy Steps!"></a>Master The Art Of Dealing Wilder In Just 10 Easy Steps!</h1><p>A successful boxing career is not just about having the punching power and hand speed. It also involves being able to take a punch and dish out one in return. The best boxers in the world have mastered the art of dealing wilder. They know how to take advantage of their opponent’s mistakes and make them pay for it.</p>
<p>In order to become a master of dealing wilder, you need to follow these 10 easy steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep your feet moving</li>
</ol>
<p>This is probably the most important step in dealing wilder. You need to keep your feet moving so that you are always in position to counter your opponent’s punches. If you stay stationary, you will be ripe for the picking.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use your jab</li>
</ol>
<p>Your jab is your best weapon when it comes to dealing wilder. You need to use it to set up your bigger punches and also to keep your opponent at bay. Don’t be afraid to throw it out there even if you don’t connect with it. The important thing is to keep your opponent guessing what you are going to do next.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Follow up with combinations</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have landed a few punches, follow up with combinations instead of just throwing one big punch. This will maximize your damage and make it harder for your opponent to defend himself. Be sure to mix up your combinations so that he can’t predict what you are going to do next.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Keep your composure</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t get too excited when you land a big punch. Stay calm and focused so that you can continue attacking your opponent. A mistake that many boxers make is they get overconfident after landing a big punch and end up getting knocked out themselves.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Watch for openings</li>
</ol>
<p>Always be on the lookout for openings in your opponent’s defense so that you can land some big shots. If he leaves his chin exposed, take advantage of it! And if he starts backing up, go in for the kill!</p>

Good for you! There are plenty of ways to move up the ranks in this industry, but one of the most versatile and sought-after positions is that of a dealer. But before you can start dealing like a pro, you need to learn the basics.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll teach you all about how to deal blackjack like a pro. From basic game rules to professional techniques, we have everything you need to know to get started. Let’s get started!</p>
<h1 id="The-Basics-How-To-Play-Blackjack"><a href="#The-Basics-How-To-Play-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="The Basics: How To Play Blackjack"></a>The Basics: How To Play Blackjack</h1><p>First things first: let’s go over the basics of how to play blackjack. At its core, the game is simple: the dealer deals two cards to each player, and two cards to themselves, with the goal being to reach 21 or come as close as possible without going over. Face cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) are worth 10 points each, and an Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points.</p>
<p>Players can choose to either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what they have). If they go over 21, they bust and lose automatically. The dealer must also hit until they reach 17 or above; at which point they must stand no matter what their hand contains. The player who reaches 21 or comes closest without busting wins the round.</p>
<p>If both the dealer and player have the same total (e.g. 19), it’s called a “push” and no one wins or loses that round. Basic blackjack strategy dictates that players should always hit on 16 or below, and stand on 17 or above - but feel free to adjust these depending on the specific situation.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to play blackjack, let’s move on to dealing tips!</p>
<h1 id="Dealing-Tips-For-Pros-How-To-Deal-Wilder-Like-A-Pro"><a href="#Dealing-Tips-For-Pros-How-To-Deal-Wilder-Like-A-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Dealing Tips For Pros: How To Deal Wilder Like A Pro!"></a>Dealing Tips For Pros: How To Deal Wilder Like A Pro!</h1><p>As a dealer, it’s important to keep control of the game at all times. This means paying close attention to both your cards and those of your opponents - as well as being aware of when it’s time to take appropriate action. Here are some tips for dealing like a pro:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Keep track of everyone’s hands - This may seem like an obvious point, but it’s crucial that dealers keep track of every player’s hand throughout the game. This will help ensure there are no mistakes - and that you maintain control of the table at all times.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pay attention to betting patterns - When players start betting more heavily on one side of the table or another, it can be an indication that they have a good hand. As a dealer, it’s important to stay ahead of the curve so you can make informed decisions about when (and how) to act accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use proper chip handling techniques - Handling chips in an incorrect manner can slow down the game and lead to confusion among players. Make sure you know how to properly stack and deal with Chips - this will help keep things running smoothly throughout gameplay sessions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Monitor Bankroll - It’s important for dealers stay mindful of their bankroll while playing; if they get too aggressive while playing they could quickly lose money . Always make sure you’re aware of your financial standing before sitting down at any blackjack table . </p>
</li>
<li><p>Be patient - In general, dealers should try not be proactive unless absolutely necessary; waiting for opportune moments will often yield better results than jumping ahead prematurely . When in doubt , hold off on making any decisions until you’ve had a chance for further observation .</p>
</li>

<h1 id="Become-A-Casino-Pro-Here’s-How-To-Deal-Blackjack-Like-A-Champ"><a href="#Become-A-Casino-Pro-Here’s-How-To-Deal-Blackjack-Like-A-Champ" class="headerlink" title="Become A Casino Pro - Here’s How To Deal Blackjack Like A Champ!"></a>Become A Casino Pro - Here’s How To Deal Blackjack Like A Champ!</h1><p>Casinos can be intimidating places, especially if you’re not familiar with the games offered. Blackjack, however, is one of the easiest casino games to play. In this article, we’ll teach you the basics of blackjack and show you how to become a casino pro!</p>
<p>To begin playing blackjack, all you need is a basic understanding of the game rules and a little bit of practice. The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (called a “blackjack”), or by scoring more points than the dealer without busting (going over 21).</p>
<p>The basic rules of blackjack are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are dealt two cards face up. The total value of these cards is your points total.</li>
<li>The dealer also deals two cards to themself, one face up and one face down. This card is known as the “hole card”.</li>
<li>You can choose to either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with the current total).</li>
<li>If your points total exceeds 21, you bust and lose the hand.</li>
<li>The winner is the player who has the highest point total at the end of the hand. If both players have 21, it is a tie and no money changes hands.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to win at blackjack, players need to make sound strategic decisions based on the cards they are dealt and the dealers upcard. For example, if you have a 12 and the dealers upcard is 6, you should hit because there is a good chance that you will get either 17 or 18 points on your next card (the dealers upcard plus your first card equals 22). However, if you have an Ace and a 5, you should stand because even if you get another Ace, your total would only be 6 which would still be below 21. As mentioned earlier, practice makes perfect so be sure to try out different strategies until you find one that works best for you!</p>
