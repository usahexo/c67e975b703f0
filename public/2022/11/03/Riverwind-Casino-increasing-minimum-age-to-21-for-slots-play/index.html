        <h1 id="Riverwind-Casino-increasing-minimum-age-to-21-for-slots-play"><a href="#Riverwind-Casino-increasing-minimum-age-to-21-for-slots-play" class="headerlink" title="Riverwind Casino increasing minimum age to 21 for slots play"></a>Riverwind Casino increasing minimum age to 21 for slots play</h1><p>The management of Riverwind Casino has announced that starting on January 1, 2019, the minimum age for playing slots will be raised to 21. This policy change is being made as part of an effort to reduce problem gambling among younger patrons.</p>
<p>Casino officials say that they have been monitoring the gaming habits of their customers and have observed a concerning trend of younger people becoming addicted to slot machines. By raising the minimum age for slots play, Riverwind hopes to discourage these individuals from spending too much time and money at the casino.</p>
<p>The new age restriction will apply not just to Riverwind Casino but also its sister property, Gold Town Casino in Norman. Anyone under 21 who wishes to play slots at either casino will need to provide proof of age.</p>
<p>This news comes as a disappointment to many local residents who enjoy gambling in their free time. Some people are already planning to travel to other states where the minimum age for slots is lower.</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, casino officials remain confident that this policy change is necessary for the well-being of their customers. They hope that those affected by the change will find other activities to enjoy at Riverwind and Gold Town Casinos.</p>
<h1 id="Oklahoma’s-Riverwind-Casino-raising-minimum-age-to-21-for-slots"><a href="#Oklahoma’s-Riverwind-Casino-raising-minimum-age-to-21-for-slots" class="headerlink" title="Oklahoma’s Riverwind Casino raising minimum age to 21 for slots"></a>Oklahoma’s Riverwind Casino raising minimum age to 21 for slots</h1><p>The Riverwind Casino, located in Norman, Oklahoma, is raising its minimum age for gambling on slot machines from 18 to 21. The change will go into effect on Friday, February 1st.</p>
<p>“The health and safety of our guests is always our number one priority,” said a spokesperson for the casino in a statement. “This new policy is intended to provide a more enjoyable experience for our guests who are of legal drinking age.”</p>
<p>The announcement has been met with mixed reactions. Some people argue that it’s unconstitutional for the government to tell adults what they can and cannot do in their own free time. Others say that it’s a responsible move that will help protect vulnerable young people from addictive behavior.</p>
<p>Riverwind isn’t the only casino making this change; both the WinStar World Casino and Resort and the Choctaw Nation Casino have also announced plans to raise their minimum age to 21.</p>
<h1 id="Riverwind-Online-Casino-OKC-Raises-Minimum-Age-Limit-For-Slots-Play-To-21"><a href="#Riverwind-Online-Casino-OKC-Raises-Minimum-Age-Limit-For-Slots-Play-To-21" class="headerlink" title="Riverwind Online Casino OKC Raises Minimum Age Limit For Slots Play To 21"></a>Riverwind Online Casino OKC Raises Minimum Age Limit For Slots Play To 21</h1><p>In a move designed to protect its youngest players, Riverwind Casino in Oklahoma City has raised the minimum age limit for slots play from 18 to 21. The new policy went into effect on Monday, June 11.</p>
<p>Riverwind Casino Marketing Director Matt clarifyed that the decision to raise the minimum age limit was not made lightly. “The safety and well-being of our guests is always our number one priority,” he said.</p>
<p>According to Matt, the average age of slot machine players at Riverwind is around 36. “Given that, we decided it was time to make this change.”</p>
<p>The decision does not affect other casino games such as blackjack and craps, which still have a minimum age requirement of 18.</p>
<h1 id="Riverwind-casino-OKC-announces-increase-in-minimum-age-to-play-slots-from-18-to-21"><a href="#Riverwind-casino-OKC-announces-increase-in-minimum-age-to-play-slots-from-18-to-21" class="headerlink" title="Riverwind casino OKC announces increase in minimum age to play slots from 18 to 21"></a>Riverwind casino OKC announces increase in minimum age to play slots from 18 to 21</h1><p>The Riverwind casino in Oklahoma City has announced that, as of September 1st, the minimum age to play slots will be increased from 18 to 21. In a press release, the casino said that the change is being made “to better align with industry standards and provide our guests with a more enjoyable experience.”</p>
<p>While the move may not please everyone, most people seem to agree that it’s a sensible decision. After all, an increasing number of casinos are making the same move, and young adults often have other things they’d rather be doing than gambling.</p>
<p>“We feel this is a positive change for our guests and our property,” said Kyle Dean, Vice President of Slot Operations at Riverwind Casino. “ Raising the minimum age to play slots will create a more pleasant environment for all of our guests.”</p>
<p>The change is also good news for casino employees, many of whom are in their early twenties. With the new age requirement in place, they’ll now be able to work in the casino without having to worry about competing against younger players.</p>
<p>So far, reaction to the news has been largely positive. “I’m glad they’re doing this,” said one guest on social media. “It’s about time something was done to make slots less appealing to kids.”</p>

The change will go into effect onAugust 1.</p>
<p>“We continuously review our policies and procedures to ensure that we are providing the best guest experience possible,” said general manager of Riverwind Casino, Matt Morgan.</p>
<p>Guests who are 18 through 20 years old will still be able to play table games and enjoy all other aspects of the casino.</p>
<p>This change comes as other casinos across the state have increased their minimum age for slot play to 21 in recent years.</p>
