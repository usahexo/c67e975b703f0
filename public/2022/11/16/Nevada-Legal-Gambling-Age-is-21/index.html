        <h1 id="Nevada-Legal-Gambling-Age-is-21"><a href="#Nevada-Legal-Gambling-Age-is-21" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Legal Gambling Age is 21"></a>Nevada Legal Gambling Age is 21</h1><p>Nevada has some of the loosest gambling laws in the United States. This includes a legal gambling age of 21. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. The following covers the legal Nevada gambling age and what activities are included.</p>
<p>The state of Nevada allows anyone 21 years or older to gamble in its casinos and card rooms. This includes playing casino games, poker, bingo, and betting on sports. There are no other restrictions on gambling such as race or residency requirements.</p>
<p>However, there are a few exceptions to the legal Nevada gambling age. Social gambling is allowed for those 18 years or older. This includes card games like bridge or poker among friends in someone’s home. It also includes betting small amounts of money on non-casino games like dice or coin tosses.</p>
<p>There is also a lower minimum legal gambling age for some games at some casinos. These include blackjack (18), craps (18), and roulette (21). Check with the casino before you visit to see if they have any lower minimums for other games.</p>
<p>If you are under 21 years old but want to gamble, you can go to one of Nevada’s Indian reservations casinos. These casinos have their own rules about the minimum legal gambling age which can vary from 18 to 21 years old.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Gaming-Commission-Sets-Minimum-Legal-Gambling-Age-at-21"><a href="#Nevada-Gaming-Commission-Sets-Minimum-Legal-Gambling-Age-at-21" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Gaming Commission Sets Minimum Legal Gambling Age at 21"></a>Nevada Gaming Commission Sets Minimum Legal Gambling Age at 21</h1><p>The Nevada Gaming Commission voted unanimously on Wednesday to set the minimum legal gambling age at 21. The new law will take effect on January 1, 2020.</p>
<p>Commission chairman Tony Alamo said, “This is a seminal moment for the commission and for the gaming industry in Nevada. Our responsibility is to protect the public, and this is an important step in doing that.”</p>
<p>Under the new law, anyone under 21 will be prohibited from gambling in casinos, playing poker or bingo, or betting on sports. They will also be banned from entering gaming areas in casinos or racetracks.</p>
<p>Republican State Senator Ira Hansen applauded the commission’s decision, saying it will help ensure that young people do not develop gambling addictions. “It’s a great day for Nevada,” he said. “We’re preventing young people from getting addicted to gambling at an early age.”</p>
<p>Democratic Assemblyman Nelson Araujo criticized the commission’s decision, saying it will drive young people to unregulated forms of gambling. “This is a bad decision that will have negative consequences for our state,” he said. “It will force young people to gamble illegally, and that’s not good for anyone.”</p>
<p>The commission’s vote comes after years of debate over the minimum legal gambling age. Advocates for raising the age argue that it will protect young people from developing addictive behaviors, while opponents say it will drive business to unregulated forms of gambling.</p>

Gambling Age in Nevada Increases to 21"></a>Minimum Legal Gambling Age in Nevada Increases to 21</h1><p>The Nevada Gaming Commission recently increased the gambling age from 18 to 21. The change, which was unanimously approved, goes into effect on January 1, 2019.</p>
<p>“It’s something that we’ve been discussing for some time and feel like it’s the right thing to do,” said gaming commission chairman Tony Alamo.</p>
<p>Alamo said the decision was based on several factors, including protecting consumers and reducing gambling addiction. He added that many other states have a 21-year-old gambling age.</p>
<p>Some 18-year-olds were not happy with the decision. Quintin Hahn said he often gambles at casinos in downtown Reno and doesn’t think it’s fair that people his age will no longer be able to do so.</p>
<p>“I turned 18 a few months ago and now I can no longer gamble here? That doesn’t seem right to me, but I guess it is what it is,” he said.</p>
<p>Others believe the increase is a positive step. Margarita Avilez works at a non-profit organization that provides assistance to people with gambling addictions. She supports the move to raise the age limit.</p>
<p>“We need to do whatever we can to help protect people from developing a gambling addiction and this is one step in the right direction,” she said.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Raises-Minimum-Legal-Gambling-Age-to-21"><a href="#Nevada-Raises-Minimum-Legal-Gambling-Age-to-21" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Raises Minimum Legal Gambling Age to 21"></a>Nevada Raises Minimum Legal Gambling Age to 21</h1><p>The Nevada Gaming Commission has unanimously approved a measure that will raise the minimum legal gambling age in the state from 18 to 21. The new policy will go into effect on January 1, 2019.</p>
<p>Governor Brian Sandoval, who chairs the commission, said that the move was made in order to protect young people from addiction and other negative consequences associated with gambling. “The decision to raise the age limit for gambling is not one we take lightly,” Governor Sandoval said in a statement.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure argue that it will hurt business at casinos and other gambling establishments. However, backers say that there is evidence that shows that most people do not begin gambling until they are 21 or older. In fact, a 2017 study by the University of Las Vegas found that only 15 percent of 18-year-olds gambled in Nevada in 2016.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Nevada has raised its minimum legal gambling age. The state increased the age from 18 to 21 in 1966, and then again raised it to 21 in 2001.</p>
